## Description

Interface (driver) software, including ROS node, for the [Microstrain](https://microstrain.com) line of inertial sensors from [Parker](http://parker.com), developed in Williston, VT.

Implemented using the Microstrain Inertial Protocol SDK ([`mip_sdk`](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/mip_sdk))

### Important Branches

There are two important branches that you may want to checkout:

* [ros](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/ROS-MSCL/tree/ros) -- Contains ROS1 implementation for this package
* [ros2](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/ROS-MSCL/tree/ros2) -- Contains ROS2 implementation for this package

## Install Instructions

### Docker

As of `v2.2.2` the `microstrain_inertial_driver` is distributed as a docker image. More information on how to use the image can be found on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/r/microstrain/ros-microstrain_inertial_driver)


### Buildfarm

As of `v2.0.5` this package is being built and distributed by the ROS build farm. If you do not need to modify the source, it is recommended to install directly from the buildfarm by running the following commands where `ROS_DISTRO` is the version of ROS you are using such as `melodic` or `noetic`:

Driver:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ros-ROS_DISTRO-microstrain-inertial-driver
```

RQT:
```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install ros-ROS_DISTRO-microstrain-inertial-rqt
```

For more information on the ROS distros and platforms we support, please see [index.ros.org](https://index.ros.org/r/microstrain_inertial/github-LORD-MicroStrain-microstrain_inertial/#noetic)


### Source

If you need to modify the source of this repository, or are running on a platform that we do not support, you can build from source by following these instructions


#### **IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT CLONING**

This repo takes advantage of git submodules in order to share code between ROS versions. When cloning the repo, you should clone with the `--recursive` flag to get all of the submodules.

If you have already cloned the repo, you can checkout the submodules by running `git submodule update --init --recursive` from the project directory

The [CMakeLists.txt](./microstrain_inertial_msgs/CMakeLists.txt) will automatically checkout the submodule if it does not exist, but it will not keep it up to date. In order to keep up to date, every
time you pull changes you should pull with the `--recurse-submodules` flag, or alternatively run `git submodule update --recursive` after you have pulled changes


#### Building from source

1. Install ROS and create a workspace: [Installing and Configuring Your ROS Environment](http://wiki.ros.org/ROS/Tutorials/InstallingandConfiguringROSEnvironment)

2. Move the entire microstrain_inertial folder (microstrain_inertial_driver, microstrain_inertial_msgs , and microstrain_common for just source) to the your_workspace/src directory.

3. Install rosdeps for this package: `rosdep install --from-paths ~/your_workspace/src -i -r -y`

4. Build your workspace:

    ```bash        
    cd ~/your_workspace
    catkin_make
    source ~/your_workspace/devel/setup.bash
    ```
   The source command will need to be run in each terminal prior to launching a ROS node.


#### Launch the node and publish data
The following command will launch the driver. Keep in mind each instance needs to be run in a separate terminal.
```bash
roslaunch microstrain_inertial_driver microstrain.launch
```

The node has some optional launch parameters that can be specified from the command line in the format `param:=value`
- `namespace` : namespace that the driver will run in. All services and publishers will be prepended with this, default: `/`
- `node_name` : name of the driver, default: `microstrain_inertial_driver`
- `debug`     : output debug logs, default: `false`
- `params_file` : path to a parameter file to override the default parameters stored in [`params.yml`](./microstrain_inertial_driver/microstrain_inertial_driver_common/config/params.yml), default: empty
    
#### Publish data from two devices simultaneously  

1. Create the following files somewhere on your system (we will assume they are stored in the `~` directory):
    1. `~/sensor_a_params.yml` with the contents:
        ```yaml
        port: /dev/ttyACM0
        ```
    2. `~/sensor_b_params.yml` with the contents:
        ```yaml
        port: /dev/ttyACM1
        ```
2. In two different terminals:
    ```bash    
    roslaunch microstrain_inertial_driver microstrain.launch node_name:=sensor_a_node namespace:=sensor_a params_file:="~/sensor_a_params.yml"
    ```
    ```bash    
    roslaunch microstrain_inertial_driver microstrain.launch node_name:=sensor_b_node namespace:=sensor_b params_file:="~/sensor_b_params.yml"
    ```

This will launch two nodes that publish data to different namespaces:
- `/sensor_a`, connected over port: `/dev/ttyACM0`
- `/sensor_b`, connected over port: `/dev/ttyACM1`

An example subscriber node can be found in the [Microstrain Examples](./microstrain_inertial_examples)  


## Docker Development

### VSCode

The easiest way to develop in docker while still using an IDE is to use VSCode as an IDE. Follow the steps below to develop on this repo in a docker container

1. Install the following dependencies:
    1. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
    1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
1. Open VSCode and install the following [plugins](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace):
    1. [VSCode Docker plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker)
    1. [VSCode Remote Containers plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
1. Open this directory in a container by following [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers#_quick-start-open-an-existing-folder-in-a-container)
    1. Due to a bug in the remote container plugin, you will need to refresh the window once it comes up. To do this, type `Ctrl+Shift+p` and type `Reload Window` and hit enter. Note that this will have to be repeated every time the container is rebuilt
1. Once the folder is open in VSCode, you can build the project by running `Ctrl+Shift+B` to trigger a build, or `Ctrl+p` to open quick open, then type `task build` and hit enter
1. You can run the project by following [this guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging)

### Make

If you are comfortable working from the command line, or want to produce your own runtime images, the [Makefile](./devcontainer/Makefile) in the [.devcontainer](./devcontainer) 
directory can be used to build docker images, run a shell inside the docker images and produce a runtime image. Follow the steps below to setup your environment to use the `Makefile`

1. Install the following dependencies:
    1. [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)
    1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
    1. [qemu-user-static](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/qemu-user-static) (for multiarch builds)
        1. Run the following command to register the qemu binaries with docker: `docker run --rm --privileged multiarch/qemu-user-static:register`

The `Makefile` exposes the following tasks. They can all be run from the `.devcontainer` directory:
* `make build-shell` - Builds the development docker image and starts a shell session in the image allowing the user to develop and build the ROS project using common commands such as `catkin_make`
* `make image` - Builds the runtime image that contains only the required dependencies and the ROS node.
* `make clean` - Cleans up after the above two tasks

### Shared codebases

Both the `ros` and `ros2` branches share most of their code by using git submodules. The following submodules contain most of the actual implementations:

* [microstrain_inertial_driver_common](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/microstrain_inertial_driver_common/tree/main) submoduled in this repo at `microstrain_inertial_driver/microstrain_inertial_driver_common`
* [microstrain_inertial_msgs_common](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/microstrain_inertial_msgs_common/tree/main) submoduled in this repo at `microstrain_inertial_msgs/microstrain_inertial_msgs_common`
* [microstrain_inertial_rqt_common](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/microstrain_inertial_rqt_common/tree/main) submoduled in this repo at `microstrain_inertial_rqt/microstrain_inertial_rqt_common`
